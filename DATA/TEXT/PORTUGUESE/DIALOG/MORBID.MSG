{100}{}{Você see Doutor Mórbido.}
{101}{}{Eu'm Doutor Mórbido, can Eu help you?}
{102}{}{Yeah, Eu need some help.}
{103}{}{Eu need some medical assistance.}
{104}{}{Não, not today.}
{105}{}{Nng.}
{106}{}{Ya.}
{107}{}{Bem, ok, then. Do come back.}
{108}{}{Bem, if not today, then perhaps sometime in the near
 future.}
{109}{}{Hopefully not. Bye.}
{110}{}{We'll just have to see, now won't we. But Eu doubt it.}
{111}{}{Hmm, lets have a look.}
{112}{}{Você seem to be in nearly perfect health. That will be $10
 for the examination.}
{113}{}{Ten caps for you to tell me that? Você gotta be kidding.}
{114}{}{Here you go. Take your money.}
{115}{}{Eu never joke. Especially when it comes to physical trauma.
 Você will pay or Eu'll have to resort to other forms of
 compensation, many of which are much more painful then
 just paying my fee.}
{116}{}{Ok, here's your money.}
{117}{}{Bite me. Eu'm leaving.}
{118}{}{Have it your way. Cougar, Flash. Show our 'patient' to
 the lab.}
{119}{}{Thank you for your business. Come again.}
{120}{}{Você do not have enough money. Eu have a very special way
 of dealing with debtors - Eu don't. Flash and Cougar,
 take our new found source of income to the lab for
 processing.}
{121}{}{Ok, Eu have your test results:}
{122}{}{Você are }
{123}{}{The total cost will be $}
{124}{}{. Payment is due before
 treatment. Não exceptions. Will you pay?}
{125}{}{Yes, Eu will pay.}
{126}{}{Não, Eu don't have the money. Will you float me?}
{127}{}{Não.}
{128}{}{Ya.}
{129}{}{Nuh.}
{130}{}{Não. Eu don't loan anyone, and Eu mean anyone, any amount
 of money. Go away, you pauper.}
{131}{}{It's your life. Good-Bye.}
{132}{}{Excellent. Let's begin. This might hurt a little . . .}
{133}{}{There you go. Come back again!}
{134}{}{Oh, back so soon. What can Eu help you with?}
{135}{}{Eu need healing.}
{136}{}{Nothing, just making small talk.}
{137}{}{Wock!}
{138}{}{Please make it somewhere else, Eu'm busy.}
{139}{}{Hmmm. Eu don't like your looks, stranger. But what can
 Eu do for you? Eu never, ever turn away a paying customer.}
{140}{}{Eu need some help.}
{141}{}{Eu need some medical assistance.}
{142}{}{Nothing today, thanks.}
{143}{}{Hep.}
{144}{}{Oh, It's you again. Eu like your style, even if Eu don't like
 you. What can Eu help you with, now?}
{145}{}{Eu need healing.}
{146}{}{Nothing, just making small talk.}
{147}{}{Wock!}
{148}{}{Oh, It's a customer! What can Eu help you with?}
{149}{}{Eu need healing.}
{150}{}{Nothing, just making small talk.}
{151}{}{Você seem exited to see me. Why?}
{152}{}{Wock!}
{153}{}{My business has dropped off recently. Eu'm happy to see
 any customers, these days. Not that Eu mind your company, of course.}
{154}{}{Excellent, Eu need some healing.}
{155}{}{Why has your business dropped off?}
{156}{}{Of course, Eu understand. Have a good day.}
{157}{}{Bem, if you do need anything, please stop by. Não one can beat my service!}
{158}{}{In case you haven't noticed, Eu got some competition.}
{159}{}{ Complaining to Killian won't do anything. He doesn't see
 anything wrong with the newcomers.}
{160}{}{ Those damn Children have moved in next door, and
 all, um, much of my business has gone to them. Eu don't like it, but Eu can't
 lower my prices to match theirs. Eu can only provide better service.}
{161}{}{Ahh, Eu do need some healing.}
{162}{}{Hmm, better prices, interesting. Thank you.}
{163}{}{Ahh, a repeat customer. Excellent these days! How can
 Eu help you?}
{164}{}{Eu need healing.}
{165}{}{Nothing, just making small talk.}
{166}{}{Wock!}
{167}{}{Eu hope you have a good reason for disturbing me. My time is extremely
 valuable.}
{168}{}{Eu'm dying here! Please help!}
{169}{}{Eu'm sorry for disturbing you, but Eu need assistance.}
{170}{}{Aggh!}
{171}{}{Eu don't find your humor funny. Please leave so Eu can
 return to my work.}
{172}{}{Hmm. Bem, you seem fine to me. Perhaps you need some rest.
 Try the Crash House, around the corner. Good night.}
{173}{}{Eu'm sorry, Eu don't treat idiots at this time of night.
 Something about full moons and lunacy, Eu suppose.
 Have a good night.}
{174}{}{Você again. Eu hope you have another good reason for disturbing
 me . . .}
{175}{}{Eu'm dying here! Please help!}
{176}{}{Eu'm sorry for disturbing you, but Eu need assistance.}
{177}{}{Aggh!}
# TRANSLATION NOTES
# When the player gets help from the Doctor, it will build a diagnosis report
# from the lines below. First, it uses one of lines 178-182 to report
# the character's status. Second, it adds on one of lines 183-186.
# If the player is poisoned, it appends one of lines 187-190; if
# the player is irradiated, it adds a line from 191-194 depending on
# the severity of the radiation, and then adds line 195 as well.
