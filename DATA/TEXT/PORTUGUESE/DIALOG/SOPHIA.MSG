{100}{}{Você see Sophia, an instructor for the Brotherhood Initiates.}
{101}{}{Ok, does anyone have any questions?}
{102}{}{Remember to ask questions if you don't understand something. Don't be shy.}
{103}{}{Review your notes.}
{104}{}{We'll be having another test tomorrow for those of you that are on section 14.}
{105}{}{Eu'm sorry, but I can't talk right now. I have a class to run.}
{106}{}{Eu understand you have something for me.}
{107}{}{Sim. Here you are.}
{108}{}{Sim, but I don't have it with me right now.}
{109}{}{Você.}
{110}{}{Eu'm sorry, but I have a class to run. Please don't disturb me.}
{111}{}{Você shouldn't be here. Vree doesn't like to be bothered at night. This is the time we meditate.}
{112}{}{We are meditating. Please leave. Come back in the morning.}
{113}{}{Leave us.}
{114}{}{Have some respect. Don't bother someone while they're meditating.}
{115}{}{Você Initiates have a lot to learn. Please leave.}
{116}{}{Don't bother me.}
{117}{}{We are not available during the night. Please see us in the morning.}
{118}{}{It's night. You should be in bed, unless you have guard duty, in which case you should be at your post.}
{200}{}{Hello Initiate. How may I help you?}
{201}{}{Eu understand you have something for me?}
{202}{}{Sim, here you are.}
{203}{}{Sim, but I don't have it with me right now.}
{204}{}{Me? Nope, sorry. You must have me mistaken for someone else.}
{205}{}{Uk.}
{206}{}{Obrigado a você very much. It was nice of you to drop these off.}
{207}{}{Um, thank you. Are you okay? Well anyway, it was nice of you to drop these off.}
{208}{}{My research would have been delayed without them. It's good to see we have such a trustworthy Initiate.
 I knew getting an outsider wouldn't be a bad decision. If you go see Michael he will have something for you.}
{301}{}{Greetings.  I have not seen you here before, are you lost?
 May I be of service?}
{302}{}{Uh......}
{303}{}{Could you direct me to the library?}
{304}{}{Eu am looking for Vree.}
{305}{}{O que is this place?}
{306}{}{If I was lost I wouldn't be asking an idiot like you for help!}
{307}{}{Eu can't believe the kind of people we accept as initiates these
 days.  God help us.}
{308}{}{This is the library.  Here we keep records of all technical data on
 weaponry and technology, and, of course, the history of the Brotherhood.}
{309}{}{Eu need a water-chip repaired.  Can you help me?}
{310}{}{Eu'd like to know more about the weapons you make here.}
{311}{}{Is this the place where I would find holo-disks?}
{312}{}{Nevermind, thank you for your time.}
{313}{}{Eu'm looking for a big gun to improve my people-killing skills.}
{314}{}{Eu am Vree's assistant.  Vree is over there.}
{315}{}{Obrigado a você.}
{316}{}{O que is it you do as Vree's assistant?}
{317}{}{My area of expertise is the history of the Brotherhood.  It sounds
 like a manufacturing problem, perhaps you should ask Vree?}
{318}{}{Eu thought the scribes knew this kind of stuff.}
{319}{}{Eu'd like to know about the Brotherhood's history.}
{320}{}{Lotta help you are!}
{321}{}{OK, thanks for your help.}
{322}{}{Você must speak with Vree, the head scribe, about that.  I have more
 important things to do.}
{323}{}{Eu will go ask Vree.}
{324}{}{More important things to do?  Like what?}
{325}{}{Você don't consider the Brotherhood's weaponry to be important?}
{326}{}{We have many holo-disks here in the library.  They are divided
 between history, technology and weapon design.}
{327}{}{Eu gostaria de ver um holo-disco sobre your technology.}
{328}{}{Eu gostaria de ver um holo-disco sobre weapon design.}
{329}{}{Eu gostaria de ver um holo-disco sobre the Brotherhood's history.}
{330}{}{Eu was sent here to ask Vree about the history of the Brotherhood.}
{331}{}{My area of specialty is the Brotherhood's history.  It seems that
 some people around here have forgotten the importance of our history.}
{332}{}{O que can you tell me about the Brotherhood's history?}
{333}{}{O que could be more important than history?}
{334}{}{Must be near your time of the month, huh?}
{335}{}{Eu'd like to ask somebody about weapons.}
{336}{}{Like keeping the history of the Brotherhood.  It seems some people
 around here have forgotten just how important our history is.}
{337}{}{Vree seems to think that the research of new weaponry and the
 information gathered from Mutant autopsies is more important than our
 history.  She has forgotten that our history is a vital part of our lives.
 It has gotten so bad that many of the new initiates don't even know who
 Roger Maxson is or what exactly he did for us.}
{338}{}{Eu'd like to learn more about the Brotherhood's history.  Do you have
 any information you can give me?}
{339}{}{Hmmm, it looks like Vree is the person I want to talk to. Good Bye.}
{341}{}{It sounds like Vree's got the right idea!  Who needs to know this
 garbage anyway!?!}
{342}{}{Eu agree that history is important, but new technology and better
 weapons is what I'm looking for.}
{343}{}{Você need to speak with Vree about things of that nature.}
{344}{}{These are things that only Scribes and Paladins have access to.
 Vree may be able to help you.}
{345}{}{Obrigado a você, I'll go ask Vree.}
{346}{}{Is there any holo-disks that I can have access to?}
{347}{}{Você're obviously not the right person to be talking to. Good Bye.}
{348}{}{Well, it's good to see someone interested in our great history.
 Unlike others around here.  Here you go. This is a disk of some of our earliest writings.}
{349}{}{Obrigado a você.}
{350}{}{Eu don't care about this crap.  Thanks for nothing.}
{351}{}{Our history is available to everyone.  So that they may learn of our
 great history...Not that any one ever looks at them.}
{352}{}{Eu would like to see anything you have on the Brother's history.}
{353}{}{Really? I don't care either, just show me the guns.}
{354}{}{Greetings.  I have not seen you here before, are you lost?  May I be
 of service?}
{355}{}{Uh......}
{356}{}{Could you direct me to the library?}
{357}{}{Eu was sent here to speak with Vree about the Brotherhood's history.}
{358}{}{If I was lost I wouldn't be asking an idiot like you for help!}
{359}{}{Você didn't get far with that did you?  Vree's is to busy with her
 "experiments" to care about history any more.}
{360}{}{Well, then who can I talk to about the history of the Brotherhood?}
{361}{}{Yeah, the Brotherhood seems to be filled with idiots.}
{362}{}{Neither do I.  Good Bye.}
{363}{}{Eu will not talk with you.}
{364}{}{How can I help you?}
{365}{}{O que do you do here?}
{366}{}{Could you tell me about the Brotherhood's history.}
{367}{}{Lamento, I thought you were someone else.  Good bye.}
{368}{}{Eu am Vree's assistant.}
{369}{}{Obrigado a você.}
{370}{}{O que is it you do as Vree's assistant?}
{371}{}{Well, it's good to see someone interested in our great history.
 Unlike others around here.  Here you go. This is a disk of some of our earliest writings.}
{372}{}{Obrigado a você.}
{373}{}{Eu don't care about this crap.  Thanks for nothing.}
{374}{}{Eu gave you the disk with some of our early writings on it.  Just
 load it up into your PIPBoy 2000 and you will be able to read it.}
{375}{}{Obrigado a você.}
{376}{}{Eu don't care about this crap.  Thanks for nothing.}
{377}{}{Eu don't like your attitude, and I choose not to talk to you.}
{378}{}{So be it. Good bye!}
{379}{}{Eu'm sorry, I was very rude and I apologize.}
{380}{}{Eu accept your apology.  Now how can I help you? }
{381}{}{O que do you do here?}
{382}{}{Could you tell me about the Brotherhood's history.}
{383}{}{Lamento, I thought you were someone else.  Good bye.}
{384}{}{Eu am Vree's assistant.  Vree is in the Learning Center.}
{400}{}{Você see an instructor for the Brotherhood Initiates.}
