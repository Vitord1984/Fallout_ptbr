{100}{}{Você ve o Motorista da Caravana.}
{101}{}{Você queria retornar ao Hub? Eu pagarei a você outros 400 scripts.}
{102}{}{Rutger should be pleased; we made it without any casualties. Did you
 want to come back with us? We're almost ready to go. The pay will be
 another 400 scripts.}
{103}{}{That was easier than I expected. Are you coming back with us?
 I'm sure another 400 scripts would come in handy.}
{104}{}{That wasn't too bad. If you want to come back with us to the Hub,
 you're welcome to. We'll pay you another 400 scripts.}
{105}{}{It's always a shame to lose someone. Rutger isn't going to take
 this well, but we could use your help getting back. Are you interested?
 Pay's still 400 scripts.}
{106}{}{Damn! I hate losing good guards. We've got to be more careful
 on our way back. We've got to cover each other. We can't let this
 happen again. I'll pay you another 400 scripts. Up for it?}
{107}{}{Are you able to come back to the Hub with us? I can't risk losing
 another guard. The pay's 400 scripts. What do you say?}
{108}{}{I really could use your help getting back. Rutger's going to kill
 me and I don't know if I can make it alone. If you're interested, pay's
 still 400 scripts. So, what do you say?}
{109}{}{It's going to be a tough trip back going alone. Would you come
 back to the Hub with me for another 400 scripts?}
{110}{}{I can't believe we lost both of the other guards. Rutger and
 Butch are going to have my ass.}
{111}{}{Sim.}
{112}{}{Nao.}
{113}{}{Ug.}
{114}{}{Ótimo. Vamos la.}
{115}{}{O que? Você esta com medo?}
{116}{}{Ah, você esta sentindo falta de um pouco de ação.}
{117}{}{That's ok. I'm sure we can make it back without a problem.
 Thanks for helping us all get here in one piece.}
{118}{}{That's ok. I understand. It'll be rough with just one guard,
 but we'll make it.}
{119}{}{Uh, ok. Eu tenho certeza que eu posso conseguir sozinho.}
{120}{}{Você esta bem? A viagem deve ter sido mais dificl pra você do que eu pensava.}
{121}{}{Você esta nas drogas?}
{122}{}{Talvez eu não queira você na minha caravana.}
{123}{}{Entao você mudou de ideia? Você quer o trabalho?}
{124}{}{Sim.}
{125}{}{Nao.}
{126}{}{Ru?}
{127}{}{Easy money. So, do you want to come back with us to the Hub?
 The pay's the same either way; but then again, so is the danger.}
{128}{}{So, you up for 600 more caps? I've got to head back to the Hub.
 Hopefully this'll be another easy one.}
{129}{}{I knew you'd come back with us. It'll be 600 caps again. You
 interested?}
{130}{}{I hate losing someone like that; that's why we pay the big bucks.
 This is a dangerous route. Well, Demetre's expecting us back soon. Pay's
 the same. Do you want to come back with us?}
{131}{}{You ready for some more action? This time we won't even get a
 scratch! I'll give you 600 caps for the trip back to the Hub.}
{132}{}{I know. It's a shame to lose someone, but at least it was in
 battle. You up for another go at it? We're heading back to the Hub.
 Give you 600 caps again.}
{133}{}{Damn, I can't believe we lost both of those guards. Demetre's
 going to be pissed. The pay will be the same, but I'm heading back
 soon. So what do you say? You and me kick some butt?}
{134}{}{Now that was a fight, it's a shame about the other two. Demetre
 won't like these losses but at least we made it. Are you going to be
 accompanying me back the Hub? It will, of course, pay 600 caps.}
{135}{}{I love the taste of battle but I hate loosing my troops. Do you
 think you and I can handle them again? I'm heading out soon -- only
 down side is that the pay's the same. Sorry, no compensation.}
{136}{}{Mug.}
{137}{}{Ok. Eu tenho certeza que nos chegaremos de volta bem.}
{138}{}{Eu so realmente preciso de um guarda de qualquer modo.}
{139}{}{Ah, eu posso derrota-los todos eu mesmo.}
{140}{}{Ah, você esta de volta! Você quer o trabalho entao, certo?}
{141}{}{Arg.}
{142}{}{Why, hello there. Looking for a job? We could use someone to help
 guard our caravans on the way back to the Hub. The pay's 400 scripts.}
{143}{}{Ok.}
{144}{}{Nao, obrigado.}
{145}{}{Zuk.}
{146}{}{Why, hello there. Looking for a job? We could use someone to help
 guard our caravans on the way back to the Hub. The pay's 600 caps, but
 mind you it's normally quite a dangerous trip.}
{147}{}{Com certeza.}
{148}{}{Yek.}
{149}{}{Deixe-me saber se você mudar sua mente. Nos saimos as 14:00 horas.}
{150}{}{Lamento, você não parece que esta em qualquer forma para o dever da caravana.}
{151}{}{Se você não consegue falar bem eu não posso contratar você.}
{152}{}{Se você quiser um trabalho, deixe as drogas.}
{153}{}{Você mudou de ideia sobre o trabalho?}
{154}{}{Sim. Eu contratarei.}
{155}{}{Lum?}
{156}{}{Aqui esta seu pagamento. Deixe-me saber se você esta voltando conosco.}
