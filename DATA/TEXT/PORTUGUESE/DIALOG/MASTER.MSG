{100}{}{You see the Master of the Super Mutants.}
{101}{Mast00}{So, what shall it be?  Do you join the Unity or do you die here?
 Juntar! Morrer! Juntar! Morrer!}
{102}{}{Eu can't win. Eu'll join you.}
{103}{}{If you can prove to me that your Unity is the best course for humanity,
 then Eu will help you.}
{104}{}{How about you die, then Eu leave?}
{105}{}{Oh, there will be death today, but not mine. Eu've got a plan.}
{106}{}{Ugh. Lee.}
{107}{Mast01}{Excellent. Your talents will be useful. But first, you must tell me
 everything about your Vault.}
{108}{}{Por quê?}
{109}{}{OK. Eu'll tell you everything you want to know.}
{110}{Mast02}{Eu will conquer it and turn all those pure strain humans into mutants.
 They will give me the army Eu need to bring peace to the entire wasteland.}
{111}{}{Sorry, Eu don't like that plan much.}
{112}{}{Sounds reasonable. Let's do it.}
{113}{Mast03}{So be it. You've dug your own grave. Grave! Grave!}
{114}{Mast04}{Eu don't have to prove anything to you! Prove.}
{115}{}{Your ego demands you tell me. All villains have this strange
 urge to explain everything.}
{116}{}{Eu can't know you represent the best future, unless you prove it to me.}
{117}{Mast05}{Very demanding for one in your tenuous position. But Eu can respect
 your needs.}
{118}{}{So tell me.}
{119}{Mast06}{The Unity will bring about the master race. Master! Master!
 One able to survive, or even thrive, in the wasteland. As long as there are
 differences, we will tear ourselves apart fighting each other. We
 need one race. Race! Race! One goal. Goal! Goal! One people . . . to
 move forward to our destiny. Destiny.}
{120}{}{That race being the mutants, of course.}
{121}{}{Eu hope we won't end up looking like you.}
{122}{Mast07}{Of course. Mutants are best equipped to deal with the world today.
 Who else? The ghouls. Please. Normals. They brought nuclear
 death to us all. This will be the age of mutants. Mutants.}
{123}{}{You mean to change all the others into mutants, as well.}
{124}{}{You're such a bigot.}
{125}{}{What about those who oppose you?}
{126}{Mast08}{All that resist, yes. All those that are required for the
 Unity as well. The remainder will be allowed to live out their days,
 but under Unity control and protection. But none shall breed, for they
 will be the last of their race.}
{127}{}{You've got a problem with your master plan.}
{128}{}{Sounds like you've got it under control. Eu'll join up.}
{129}{}{Eu think you are, all of you are, nuts and Eu need to stop you now.}
{130}{Mast09}{And what is that?}
{131}{}{You didn't take into account me! Eu'm stopping you right here, right now!}
{132}{}{You can't possibly take on the entire world.}
{133}{}{Eu happen to know that your mutants are sterile.}
{134}{Mast10}{Eu'm not after the world, yet. When Eu turn your fellow vault-dwellers
 into mutants, my forces will be too strong for any to stand against!
 But don't worry, you won't care. Care! Care!}
{135}{Mast11}{Preposterous! The FEV-2 virus doesn't destroy the reproductive organs
 of those it mutates.}
{136}{}{Perhaps the virus didn't sterilize people once, but it does now.}
{137}{}{Have you talked to any of your mutants about this?}
{138}{}{Maybe it's all that extra radiation.}
{139}{Mast12}{Do you have proof?}
{140}{}{Of course, Eu do! Here it is . . .}
{141}{}{Take my word for it, it happens.}
{142}{}{Ask your own mutants.}
{143}{Mast13}{This proves nothing! You will pay for your insolence. Pay!}
{144}{}{Eu must digest this information. One moment.}
{145}{Mast14}{Eu must digest this information. One moment . . . Eu understand now.
 You made a clever forgery. You made this up to fool me. Fool! Me!}
{146}{}{What!? Eu don't understand, Eu thought it was correct!}
{147}{}{You're lying! You're denying the facts in front of you!}
{148}{Mast16}{You will pay for what you have done! Pay! Done.}
{149}{Mast17}{But it cannot be. This would mean that all my work has been for
 nothing. Everything that Eu have tried to . . . a failure!  It can't be.
 Be. Be. Be.}
{150}{}{Sorry, this isn't an option for you. Your race will die out
 after this generation.}
{151}{}{Maybe there is something that can be done. Perhaps you need more
 test subjects.}
{152}{Mast18}{Yes. More subjects. Eu think Eu shall start with you. Do! Do!}
{153}{Mast19}{Eu . . . don't think that Eu can continue. Continue? To have done the
 things Eu have done in the name of progress and healing. It was
 madness. Eu can see that now. Madness. Madness? There is no hope.
 Leave now, leave while you still have hope . . .}
{154}{Mast20}{Eu believe Eu shall. Don't move.}
{155}{Mast21}{My scientists assure me that nothing is wrong.
 What do you say to that? Say! Say!}
{156}{}{Did you think to ask a female mutant?}
{157}{}{Ask one of your Lieutenants.}
{158}{}{They're afraid of you. You think they'll tell you the truth?}
{159}{Mast22}{One moment. He cannot be reached. He must be dead and Eu can
 guess who killed him. Killed! Kill!}
{160}{Mast23}{He denies everything. And he says he knows who started
 this rumor . . .}
{161}{Mast24}{Eu think Eu know who the liar is. Liar!}
{162}{Mast25}{Reasonable. One moment. Are you sure? What about the other females?
 It cannot be. Be.}
{163}{}{Sorry, your race is doomed.}
{164}{}{Excuse me while Eu gloat . . . Told ya so!}
{165}{Mast26}{Without any proof, Eu'm afraid Eu can't believe you. Now, you will join
 my army as a mutant or you will die! Morrer! Juntar!}
{166}{}{Better dead than like you.}
{167}{}{It means giving up everything Eu know, but Eu'll join.}
{168}{Mast27}{Your humor will not save you now. Do you accept my offer, or not? Not!
 Accept!}
{169}{}{Not.}
{170}{}{OK, it's better than dying . . .}
{171}{Mast28}{Radiation has no effect on us. The FEV virus makes us immune.
 Your argument is weak, and so are you.}
{172}{Mast29}{Oh, Eu think you are wrong. But just to be sure, Eu will order
 this matter researched. After Eu have taken care of you. Care. Care!}
{173}{Mast30}{My only problem is you. Now, will you work for the Unity, or not?}
{174}{}{Not.}
{175}{}{Sure.}
{176}{Mast31}{They will be punished for their insolence.}
{177}{}{You mean to kill them all?}
{178}{}{Then Eu must stop you now!}
{179}{Mast32}{Of course not. Most will be offered a chance to become
 a mutant. Those who deny this opportunity will be sterilized and let go.
 Those that resist will be executed.}
{180}{}{You are one sick puppy. Time to put you down.}
{181}{}{Hmm, Eu'm not big on being executed . . . Eu'm joining.}
{182}{Mast33}{We are all biased, are we not?  We each care more about
 our individual communities than other people. We haven't changed, and
 Eu'll tell you something else . . .}
{183}{}{What's that?}
{184}{Mast34}{We won't change. Not unless we are of one people. One. One. One. One
 race. One. One. One. The Unity will allow us to move beyond these
 petty concerns and deal with the major problems at hand. You want to
 be a part of that, don't you? Part. Don't.}
{185}{}{You've convinced me. Eu'll join the Unity.}
{186}{}{Eu want a part of you . . . your head!}
{187}{Mast35}{Of course! The mutants will survive! The mutants will rebuild this
 world! And only as a mutant, will you be allowed to live! Live. Morrer!}
{188}{}{Live!}
{189}{}{Morrer!}
{190}{}{All you care about is your mutants and their Unity.}
{191}{Mast36}{Eu am no villain. You have no idea what Eu, or the Unity is about.}
{192}{}{Then tell me what you are about.}
{193}{}{You are a villain. You're just denying your inner feelings.}
{194}{Mast37}{Eu don't have to prove myself to you. Using your logic, that must,
 prove Eu am not a villain. It would be a hopeless cause to explain it to you. }
{195}{Mast38}{Oh? Please, what sort of plan might that be?}
{196}{}{Eu'm going to set off a nuclear device in this Vault. It will explode
 shortly, taking you all to hell!}
{197}{}{Eu'll kill you and that'll make it difficult for you to continue, right?}
{198}{}{Eu convinced the Brotherhood of Steel to invade this place if Eu was
 captured and not set free. They will be here any moment.}
{199}{Mast39}{You might be telling the truth. It doesn't matter, but Eu will let
 you go for now.}
{200}{Mast40}{You are lying. It will be the last lie that you tell. }
{201}{Mast41}{One moment while Eu check out your story. You might be telling the
 truth. Guards! Take this human to the reactor core. Deal with the
 problem before it's too late.}
{202}{Mast42}{Eu doubt even the FEV will help you. Why am Eu talking? It's
 unlikely you even understand . . .}
{203}{Mast43}{You must be joking. }
{204}{Mast44}{My patience is almost at an end with you. Now, will you join the
 Unity or not? Juntar. Not!}
{205}{}{Yes.}
{206}{}{Não.}
{207}{Mast45}{Fine. Then you can die here and now!}
{208}{Mast46}{You have disarmed the device. Excellent. Tell me, is there
 anything you wanted to say before Eu kill you?}
{209}{}{Yes, can Eu join up with you now?}
{210}{}{Even dead, Eu'll still look better than you.}
{211}{Mast47}{Não. Não. Não. Não.}
{212}{Mast200}{Eu sou o Mestre. Eu não tenho que responder a você.}
{213}{Mast201}{Eu am not here to answer your questions. You are here to answer mine.}
{214}{Mast202}{Once Eu have the location of your vault, Eu will fulfill my destiny!
 Destiny! Destiny! Destiny!}
{215}{Mast203}{You think you can destroy me!? Destroy! Me?}
{300}{}{Duh!}
